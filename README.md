# leaflet.reachability
Plugin for the Leaflet JavaScript library to show areas of reachability based on time or distance for different modes of travel using the [openrouteservice isochrones API](https://openrouteservice.org/documentation/#/reference/isochrones).

You can [view the demo](https://www.trafforddatalab.io/leaflet.reachability/leaflet.reachability_example.html) to get an idea of what it can do with the basic options, or view a more customised implementation (which uses more of the available styling options) in our [Explore mapping application](https://www.trafforddatalab.io/maps/explore/).

More detailed step-by-step instructions and a full implementation guide will follow here shortly...
