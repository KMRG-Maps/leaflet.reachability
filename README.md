# leaflet.reachability
Plugin for the [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com) JavaScript library to show areas of reachability based on time or distance for different modes of travel using the [openrouteservice isochrones API](https://openrouteservice.org/documentation/#/reference/isochrones).

You can [view the demo](https://www.trafforddatalab.io/leaflet.reachability/leaflet.reachability_example.html) to get an idea of what it can do with the basic options, or view a more customised implementation (which uses more of the available styling options) in our [Explore mapping application](https://www.trafforddatalab.io/maps/explore/).

We have also created a [short video](https://vimeo.com/291529944) showing the plugin in use and published an [article](https://medium.com/@traffordDataLab/out-of-reach-introducing-our-distance-and-travel-time-plugin-859932cb12e5) explaining the benefits of using network buffers rather than euclidean distance when determining reachability.
